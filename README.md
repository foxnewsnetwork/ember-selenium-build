# Ember-selenium-build

[demo site](https://foxnewsnetwork.gitlab.io/ember-selenium-build/)
A pre-render tool that builds a few pages of your ember app as a static site

## Why You Need This?
Especially if we already have ember fastboot?

If you're using fastboot, you indeed don't need this. However, for the individual small-ish projects that don't demand setting up an entire back-end, this project is perfect

## How?

Run the commands
```sh
ember selenium-build:build
```

## Installation

* `git clone` this repository
* `npm install`
* `bower install`

## Running

* `ember server`
* Visit your app at http://localhost:4200.

## Running Tests

* `npm run server-test`

## Building

* `ember build`
